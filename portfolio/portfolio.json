		"title": "Scrabble – CLI Scrabble Helper",
		"role": "Developer",
		"type": "Academic project",
		"audience": ["Recruiters", "Instructors", "Developers"],
		"status": "Completed"
	},

	"overview": {
		"summary": "A command-line Scrabble helper program built with Deno and TypeScript. The project computes Scrabble word scores and determines the highest-value word from a list, with a focus on clean CLI interaction and simple algorithm design.",
		"problem": "Manually calculating Scrabble scores for multiple words can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when validating words against a dictionary.",
		"solution": "A lightweight CLI tool that accepts command-line arguments, validates words against a predefined list, and accurately computes total and highest Scrabble scores."
	},

	"responsibilities": [
		"Designed and implemented a command-line application using Deno and TypeScript",
		"Handled command-line arguments using Deno.args",
		"Implemented Scrabble letter scoring logic using constants",
		"Validated words against a predefined dictionary",
		"Implemented logic for total score and highest-value word calculation",
		"Ensured case-insensitive input handling"
	],

	"tech_stack": ["TypeScript", "Deno", "CLI", "GitHub"],

	"architecture": {
		"approach": "Single-entry CLI application with logic decomposed into small, focused functions, emphasizing readability, maintainability, and academic best practices.",
		"data_flow": "Command-line arguments are parsed at runtime; words are validated against a predefined list; scores are calculated using letter-value mappings and returned via standard output.",
		"deployment": "Not deployed. The application is intended to be run locally using Deno."
	},

	"key_features": [
		"Total Scrabble score calculation",
		"Highest-value word determination",
		"Case-insensitive word handling",
		"Dictionary-based word validation",
		"Clear command-line output"
	],

	"challenges_and_learnings": [
		"Designing clear and predictable CLI program flow",
		"Parsing and validating command-line arguments",
		"Structuring TypeScript code without unnecessary complexity",
		"Separating scoring logic from input handling",
		"Handling edge cases such as invalid words and empty input"
	],

		"TypeScript programming",
		"Deno CLI development",
		"Algorithmic problem solving",
		"Input validation",
		"Command-line interface design",
		"Academic project planning and execution"
	],

	"future_improvements": [
		"Add support for bonus tiles (double letter, triple word, etc.)",
		"Improve error messaging for invalid usage",
		"Add automated tests for scoring functions",
		"Support reading words from a file"
	],
